# Intro

At the beginning of 2023, Sarah Drasner, who as Director of Engineering at Google also heads the Angular team, coined the term Angular Renaissance. This term means a renewal of the framework that has supported us in the development of modern JavaScript solutions for seven years now.

This renewal is incremental and backwards compatible and takes current trends from the world of front-end frameworks into account. This is primarily about developer experience and performance. Standalone Components and Signals are two well-known features that have already emerged as part of this movement.

In this book, I discuss the innovations that come with the Angular Renaissance using several examples. 

## Structure

This book is subdivided into 14 chapters grouped to four parts discussing different aspects of modern Angular.

### Part 1: Standalone Components

The first part discusses Standalone Components, how they play together with traditional NgModule-based code, and what they mean for your architecture.

Chapters in part 1:

- Standalone Components: Mental Model & Compatibility
- Architecture with Standalone Components

### Part 2: Improved APIs

This part goes in depth with the new Standalone APIs -- renewed Angular APIs for routing, lazy loading, http access, web components, and testing.

Chapters in part 2:

- Standalone APIs for Routing and Lazy Loading
- Angular Elements with Standalone Components
- The Refurbished HttpClient - Standalone APIs and Functional Interceptors
- Testing Angular Standalone Components
- Patterns for Custom Standalone APIs in Angular
  
### Part 3: Preparing for and Migrating to Standalone

In this part you learn how to migrate your existing code to Standalone.

Chapters in part 3:

- How to prepare for Standalone Components?
- Automatic Migration to Standalone Components in 3 Steps

### Part 4: Signals

Signals are the future of change detection in Angular. The fourth part shows how to use them in your applications.

Chapters in part 4:

- Signals in Angular: The Future of Change Detection
- Component Communication with Signals: Inputs, Two-Way Bindings, and Content/ View Queries
- Successful with Signals in Angular - 3 Effective Rules for Your Architecture

### Part 5: Control Flow & Performance

The final part explains what's behind the new control flow syntax, how to improve the performance with deferable views, SSR, and hydration, and how to speed up the build with the new esbuild-based `ApplicationBuilder`.

Chapters in part 5:

- Built-in Control Flow and Deferrable Views
- esbuild and the new Application Builder
